# Cup bottomless

This project aims at building an album site with a load-more button and upload feature for Next JS, Typescript, Firebase, and Chakra UI practices.

## Description

The goal of the exercise is to get familiar with implementing Typescript in the Next JS environment while wiring up the data and authentication provided by Firebase. The site also uses Chakra UI to achieve a minimal, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

## Next step

With the experience gained from this exercise, I am well-prepared for my next project, which will involve more complex user-generated content.
